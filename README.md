# MealsApp
Simple React Native app to practice introductory topics

This app displays lists of meals including their list of ingredients and steps to make each one. This was done to practice topics such as local state, app-wide state, multiple navigation systems, styling, and more. 

IMPORTANT: This app will not work without the node_modules folder which comes when you create a new react app with expo. So if you want to use this app, first create a new react app with expo then bring in all the components and screens. There were too many files in node_modules to easily include it here.
